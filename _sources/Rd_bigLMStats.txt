purpose:  

 Efficiently compute basic statistical inference from regressions with multiple outcomes
 
description:  

   This function simplifies calculating p-values from linear models in which there are many outcome variables, such as in voxel-wise regressions.  To perform such an analysis in R, you can concatenate the outcome variables column-wise into an n by p matrix  y , where there are n subjects and p outcomes (see  Examples ).  Calling  lm(y~x)  calculates the coefficients, but statistical inference is not provided.  This function provides basic statistical inference efficiently.
