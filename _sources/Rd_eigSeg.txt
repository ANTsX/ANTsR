eigSeg 
=========================

purpose:  

 Segmentation for eigenanatomy.
 
description:  

 Segment a mask into regions based on the max value in an image list.   At a given voxel the segmentation label will contain the index to the image that has the largest value.  If the 3rd image has the greatest value, the segmentation label will be 3 at that voxel.
 

usage:  

 eigsegimage<-eigSeg( mask, imageList , applySegmentationToImages )
 
examples: 

.. sourcecode:: r
    

    mylist <- list(image1, image2)
    
    # both approaches below are ok
    
    myseg <- eigSeg(mask, mylist)
    
    myseg <- eigSeg(mask, c("a.nii.gz", "b.nii.gz"))
