purpose:  

 Motion Correction
 
description:  

 This program is a user-level registration application meant to utilize ITKv4-only classes. 
 The user can specify any number of  stages  where a  stage  consists of -- a transform, an image metric, number of iterations, shrink factors, and smoothing sigmas for each level. Specialized for 4D time series data: fixed image is 3D, moving image should be the 4D time series. Fixed image is a reference space or time slice.
 

usage:  

 antsMotionCorr( <list of named arguments> )
 
 <list of named arguments> -- an R list of name-value pairs as described in the section 'Arguments'
 
 see section: Arguments, Examples
 
examples: 

.. sourcecode:: r
    

    antsMotionCorr(list(d = 3, a = img, o = avg_img))
    
    antsMotionCorr(list(d = 3, o = list(moco_params, moco_img, avg_img), m = list(name = "MI", 
        avg_img, img, 1, 32, 50), t = "Rigid[0.01]", i = 25, u = 1, e = 1, s = 0, 
        f = 1, n = 25))
