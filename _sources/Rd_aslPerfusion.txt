aslPerfusion 
=========================

purpose:  

 ASL-based Perfusion from PASL, CASL or pCASL.
 
description:  

 This function will estimate perfusion from an ASL time series using a (robust) regression approach. It will do motion correction, compcorr, factor out nuisance variables and use regression to estimate the perfusion itself.  It will mask the image too based on a simple procedure ( should fix this in the future by allowing the user to optionally pass a mask in from the outside ).   WARNING: the function will estimate the m0 image from the mean of the control tags assuming that the data is acquired T C T C as is most of JJ's data.  Quantitative CBF can be obtained by mutiplying the output of this function by a scalar. 
 

usage:  

 aslPerfusion( asl_antsr_image_or_filename, maskThresh=500,  moreaccurate = TRUE , dorobust = 0 )
