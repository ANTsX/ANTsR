networkEiganat 
=========================

purpose:  

 Convenience wrapper for eigenanatomy decomposition.
 
description:  

 Decomposes a matrix into sparse eigenevectors to maximize explained variance.
 

usage:  

 networkEiganat( Xin, sparam = c(0.1, 0.1), k = 5, its = 100, gradparam = 1, mask = NA, v, prior, pgradparam = 0.01)
 
examples: 

.. sourcecode:: r
    

    mat <- replicate(100, rnorm(20))
    
    mydecom <- networkEiganat(mat)
