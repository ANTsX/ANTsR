Description: Expose ITK library routines to R through the use of Rcpp package.
	     Provide a set of convenient routines for R to use the ITK C++
	     library without having to write C++ code to use the highly
	     templated ITK library. The set of functions provided will offer
	     a subset of functionalities offered by ITK itself to work with 
	     images.
