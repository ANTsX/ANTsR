Description: ANTsR interfaces state of the art image processing with R statistical methods.  The project grew out of the need, at University of Pennsylvania, to develop large-scale analytics pipelines that track provenance from scanner to scientific study. ANTsR wraps an ANTs and ITK C++ core via Rcpp to access these frameworks from within R and support reproducible analyses.
