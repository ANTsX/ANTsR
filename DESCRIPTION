Description: ANTsR interfaces state of the art image processing with R
    statistical methods. The project grew out of the need, at University of
    Pennsylvania, to develop large-scale analytics pipelines that track provenance
    from scanner to scientific study. ANTsR wraps an ANTs and ITK C++ core via Rcpp
    to access these frameworks from within R and support reproducible analyses.
    Specialized functionality in ANTsR includes image segmentation and
    registration along imaging specific variations of principal component
    and canonical correlation analysis.
