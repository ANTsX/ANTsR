  abstract = {In recent years, graph theoretical analyses of neuroimaging data
	have increased our understanding of the organization of large-scale
	structural and functional brain networks. However, tools for pipeline
	application of graph theory for analyzing topology of brain networks
	is still lacking. In this report, we describe the development of
	a graph-analysis toolbox (GAT) that facilitates analysis and comparison
	of structural and functional network brain networks. GAT provides
	a graphical user interface (GUI) that facilitates construction and
	analysis of brain networks, comparison of regional and global topological
	properties between networks, analysis of network hub and modules,
	and analysis of resilience of the networks to random failure and
	targeted attacks. Area under a curve (AUC) and functional data analyses
	(FDA), in conjunction with permutation testing, is employed for testing
	the differences in network topologies; analyses that are less sensitive
	to the thresholding process. We demonstrated the capabilities of
	GAT by investigating the differences in the organization of regional
	gray-matter correlation networks in survivors of acute lymphoblastic
	leukemia (ALL) and healthy matched Controls (CON). The results revealed
	an alteration in small-world characteristics of the brain networks
	in the ALL survivors; an observation that confirm our hypothesis
	suggesting widespread neurobiological injury in ALL survivors. Along
	with demonstration of the capabilities of the GAT, this is the first
	report of altered large-scale structural brain networks in ALL survivors.},
