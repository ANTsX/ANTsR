\title{Compute Dice overlap for sparse vectors with optional quantile thresholding}
\usage{
dice_overlap_soft_vector(x, y, quantile = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector.}

\item{y}{Numeric vector of the same length as `x`.}

\item{quantile}{Numeric between 0 and 1. If > 0, values below the given quantile
(based on absolute value) are set to 0 before computing Dice.}
}
\value{
Dice similarity coefficient (between 0 and 1).
}
\description{
This function computes the Dice similarity coefficient for two vectors,
either using a soft binary threshold (non-zero = 1), or by thresholding
values by quantile.
}
\examples{
dice_overlap_soft_vector(c(0,1,0,2), c(3,1,0,0))  # returns 0.5
dice_overlap_soft_vector(c(0,0,0,0), c(0,0,0,0))  # returns 1
dice_overlap_soft_vector(c(1,2,3,4), c(1,0,0,4), quantile=0.5)  # uses threshold
}
