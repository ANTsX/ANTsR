\title{Symmetrize a Matrix}
\usage{
symm(A)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{Numeric matrix to symmetrize.}
}
\value{
Numeric matrix, the symmetric part (A + A^T)/2.
}
\description{
Computes the symmetric part of a matrix by averaging it with its transpose.
}
\details{
The symmetric part is defined as \eqn{\mathrm{sym}(A) = (A + A^T)/2}, ensuring the result is symmetric.
This is used in computing the Riemannian gradient for the Stiefel manifold.
}
\examples{
A <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), 2, 2)
symm(A)
}
