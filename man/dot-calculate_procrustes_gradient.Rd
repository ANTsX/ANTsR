\title{Calculate the Gradient for the Procrustes-like Correlation Objective}
\usage{
.calculate_procrustes_gradient(X, U, V)

.calculate_procrustes_gradient(X, U, V)

.calculate_procrustes_gradient(X, U, V)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A centered data matrix for a single modality [n x p].}

\item{U}{The current shared basis matrix [n x k], with orthonormal columns.}

\item{V}{The current loading matrix for the modality [p x k].}
}
\value{
A matrix [p x k] representing the gradient of the objective.

A matrix [p x k] representing an **ascent direction** for the objective J.

A matrix [p x k] representing an **ascent direction** for the objective J.
}
\description{
This function computes the gradient of the objective function:
J(V) = tr(U'XV) / ||U'XV||_F
with respect to the loading matrix V.

Computes the correct analytical gradient for the objective
  J = tr(U'XV) / ||U'XV||_F. This version has been rigorously derived
  and verified against numerical differentiation.
}
\details{
The returned gradient is an ascent direction for J, which is a descent
direction for the energy E = -J, suitable for use in the simlr optimizer.
