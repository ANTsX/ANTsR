\title{Visualize Relationship Between Two Low-Rank Matrices and Perform Statistical Tests}
\usage{
visualize_lowrank_relationships(
  X1,
  X2,
  V1,
  V2,
  plot_title = "Low-Rank Projections Relationship"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X1}{A numeric matrix.}

\item{X2}{A numeric matrix.}

\item{V1}{A numeric matrix with the same number of columns as \code{X1}.}

\item{V2}{A numeric matrix with the same number of columns as \code{X2}.}

\item{plot_title}{A character string specifying the title of the plot. Defaults to "Low-Rank Projections Relationship".}
}
\value{
A list containing the ggplot object, canonical correlations, Wilks' lambda test results, RV coefficient, and the correlation matrix.
}
\description{
This function computes low-rank projections of two matrices, visualizes the pairwise correlations,
and performs statistical tests including Wilks' lambda test and RV coefficient to assess the significance of the relationship.
