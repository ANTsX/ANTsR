\usage{
aslCensoring(asl, mask = NA, nuis = NA, method = "outlier", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{asl}{input asl image}

\item{mask}{mask for calculating perfusion}

\item{nuis}{fixed nuisance parameters}

\item{method}{one of 'outlier', 'robust', or 'scor'.  See \code{Details}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to pass to censoring method.  See \code{Details.}}
}
\value{
vector of the same length as number of timepoints in \code{asl}, with
 1 indicating the corresponding timepoint is included and 0 indicating exclusion.

\description{
Censor bad volumes from ASL data.
}
\details{
\code{aslCensoring} is an interface to ASL timepoint censoring algorithms.
Three options are currently provided, with different additional arguments:
\enumerate{
 \item{\code{outlier}}{ Outlier rejection from Tan et al.  This method rejects
   volumes that are either far from the mean of the time-series or whose
   standard deviation is far from the standard deviations of the individual volumes.
   Accepts two additional arguments:
     \itemize{
        \item{\code{sigma.mean}: }{how many standard
        deviations the mean of the volume can be from the
        mean of all the volumes before
        being thrown out.}
        \item{\code{sigma.sd}: }{how many standard deviations from the
        mean of standard deviations can the standard deviation of the volume be
        before being thrown out.}
     }
}
 \item{\code{robust}}{ Uses a robust regression approach to estimate volumes
   with high leverage.  Accepts three arguments:
   \itemize{
     \item{\code{nuis}:}{ Nuisance regressors to use as covariates.}
     \item{\code{robthresh}:}{ Threshold for weights on leverage estimates.  Points
        with weights under this value will be thrown out; defaults to 0.95.}
     \item{\code{skip}:}{ Proportion of points to skip when estimating leverage.
       Defaults to 20 (1/20 of the image is used).}
    }
  }
  \item{\code{scor}}{ SCOR method of Dolui et al.  No parameters.}
}
}
