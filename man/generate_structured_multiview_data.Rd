\title{Generate a Sophisticated Simulated Multi-View Dataset}
\usage{
generate_structured_multiview_data(
  n_subjects,
  n_features,
  k_shared,
  k_specific,
  noise_sd = 0.1,
  sparsity_level = 0.5,
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_subjects}{The number of subjects (rows).}

\item{n_features}{A vector of integers specifying the number of features for each view.}

\item{k_shared}{The number of latent components common to ALL views.}

\item{k_specific}{A vector of integers specifying the number of unique latent
components for EACH view. If a single number is given, it's recycled.}

\item{noise_sd}{The standard deviation of the Gaussian noise added to the data.}

\item{sparsity_level}{The proportion of elements in the shared loading matrix (V_f)
to set to zero. A value between 0 and 1. Defaults to 0.5.}

\item{seed}{An optional random seed for reproducibility.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \item{data_list}{A named list of the final [n x p] data matrices.}
  \item{ground_truth}{A list containing the true latent structures:
    \itemize{
      \item `U_shared`: The ground truth shared basis [n x k_shared]. This is what
        `simlr` should aim to recover.
      \item `V_shared`: A list of the ground truth shared loading matrices
        [p x k_shared]. This is what the `simlr` `v` matrices should be compared against.
      \item `U_specific`: A list of the ground truth modality-specific bases.
      \item `U_combined`: The full latent basis [n x (k_shared + sum(k_specific))]
        that was used to generate the data.
    }
  }
}
\description{
This function creates simulated multi-view data with a complex and realistic
ground truth, containing both shared and modality-specific latent signals.
