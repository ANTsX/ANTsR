\usage{
jointIntensityFusion3D(targetI, targetIMask, atlasList, beta = 4, rad = NA,
  doscale = TRUE, doNormalize = TRUE, maxAtlasAtVoxel = c(1, Inf),
  rho = 0.01, usecor = FALSE, rSearch = 0, slices = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{targetI}{antsImage to be approximated}

\item{targetIMask}{mask with value 1}

\item{atlasList}{list containing antsImages}

\item{beta}{weight sharpness, default to 2}

\item{rad}{neighborhood radius, default to 4}

\item{doscale}{scale neighborhood intensities}

\item{doNormalize}{normalize each image range to 0, 1}

\item{maxAtlasAtVoxel}{min/max n atlases to use at each voxel}

\item{rho}{ridge penalty increases robustness to outliers but also
makes image converge to average}

\item{usecor}{employ correlation as local similarity}

\item{rSearch}{radius of search, default is 2}

\item{slices}{vector defining slices to use (speeds parameter selection)}
}
\value{
approximated image, segmentation and probabilities

\description{
Estimates an image/labelset from another set of 3D images
}
\details{
intensity generalization of joint label fusion, does not support segmentation.
this version is more efficient, memory-wise, for 3D images. it is a thin
wrapper that goes slice-by-slice but produces the same results.
This program is for research.  For studies, please use jointLabelFusion in 
ANTs or in ANTsR.
