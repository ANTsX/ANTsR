\title{Write all SiMLR outputs to disk (portable version)}
\usage{
write_simlr(simlr_object, file_prefix)
}
\arguments{
\item{simlr_object}{A named list containing the full SiMLR outputs (e.g., `mysim$simlrX`).}

\item{file_prefix}{A character string used as the prefix for the output directory name.}
}
\value{
No return value, called for side effects.
}
\description{
This function saves the complete set of SiMLR outputs (e.g., `u`, `v`, energy paths,
error metrics, and other metadata) to a structured directory on disk.
Matrices and data frames are written as UTF-8 CSV files, while other R objects
are serialized as `.rds`. A manifest is written with **relative paths** to track
the saved components, ensuring portability across systems.
