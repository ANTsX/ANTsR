\title{Compute the Average Invariant Orthogonality Defect for Multiple Features}
\usage{
simlr_feature_orth(p)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{A list of matrices (or data frames), each representing a set of feature vectors.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the average invariant orthogonality defect across all the provided feature matrices.
}
\description{
This function calculates the average invariant orthogonality defect for a list of features, using the `invariant_orthogonality_defect` function. The orthogonality defect measures the deviation of feature vectors from orthogonality.
}
\details{
The function iterates over each matrix in the list `p` and applies the `invariant_orthogonality_defect` function to calculate the orthogonality defect for each matrix. The final result is the average orthogonality defect across all matrices.
}
\examples{
# Example data: Two sets of feature matrices
feature1 <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2)
feature2 <- matrix(c(7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), nrow = 2)
feature_list <- list(feature1, feature2)

# Calculate the average orthogonality defect
avg_orthogonality_defect <- simlr_feature_orth(feature_list)
print(avg_orthogonality_defect)
