\title{Create a Smoothed Sparse Matrix via Permutation Ensemble Averaging}
\usage{
ensembled_sparsity(X, default_constraint = "either")
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix [p_features x k_components].}

\item{default_constraint}{The constraint to apply to all other columns.}
}
\value{
A single, averaged sparse matrix with the same dimensions as X.
}
\description{
This function removes the bias of treating a single column as "special" by
running the `sparsify_by_column_winner` function multiple times. In each run,
the columns of the input matrix are permuted so that a different column is
in the "first" position. The results are un-permuted and then averaged to
produce a stable, unbiased sparse representation.
}
\examples{
set.seed(42)
mat <- matrix(rnorm(15), nrow=5, ncol=3)
mat[2,1] <- 10; mat[4,2] <- -12; mat[1,3] <- 14
print("Original Matrix:")
print(round(mat, 2))

# Keep one column dense, sparsify others by magnitude ('either')
# sparse_ensembled <- ensembled_sparsity(mat,
#  default_constraint = "either"
# )
