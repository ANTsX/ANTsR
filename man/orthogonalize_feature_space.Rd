\title{Orthogonalize a List of Matrices via Gradient Descent with Convergence Check}
\usage{
orthogonalize_feature_space(
  matrix_list,
  max_iterations = 100,
  learning_rate = 0.05,
  tolerance = 1e-04,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix_list}{A list of numeric matrices. All matrices must have the
same number of columns (e.g., k components).}

\item{max_iterations}{The maximum number of gradient descent iterations to perform.}

\item{learning_rate}{The step size for each update.}

\item{tolerance}{The convergence threshold. The algorithm stops if the absolute
change in the total orthogonality defect between iterations is less than this
value.}

\item{verbose}{If TRUE, prints the orthogonality error at each iteration.}
}
\value{
A list of orthogonalized matrices with the same dimensions as the input.
}
\description{
This function takes a list of matrices (with the same number of columns) and
iteratively updates them to make the columns within each matrix more orthogonal.
It stops when the change in the total orthogonality error is below a given
tolerance or when the maximum number of iterations is reached.
