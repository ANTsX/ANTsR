  abstract = {We contribute a novel and interpretable dimensionality reduction strategy,
	eigenanatomy, that is tuned for neuroimaging data. The method approximates
	the eigendecomposition of an image set with basis functions (the
	eigenanatomy vectors) that are sparse, unsigned and are anatomically
	clustered. We employ the eigenanatomy vectors as anatomical predictors
	to improve detection power in morphometry. Standard voxel-based morphometry
	(VBM) analyzes imaging data voxel-by-voxel--and follows this with
	cluster-based or voxel-wise multiple comparisons correction methods
	to determine significance. Eigenanatomy reverses the standard order
	of operations by first clustering the voxel data and then using standard
	linear regression in this reduced dimensionality space. As with traditional
	region-of-interest (ROI) analysis, this strategy can greatly improve
	detection power. Our results show that eigenanatomy provides a principled
	objective function that leads to localized, data-driven regions of
	interest. These regions improve our ability to quantify biologically
	plausible rates of cortical change in two distinct forms of neurodegeneration.
	We detail the algorithm and show experimental evidence of its efficacy.},

  abstract = {The United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) commit significant

	reproducibility in the biomedical imaging sciences. Here, we report
	and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging
	Tools (ANTs), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The ANTs open
	source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image
	registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative
	morphometric analysis. In this work, we use ANTs to quantify, for
	the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and
	deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We
	detail the ANTs implementation of three similarity metrics: squared
	intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise
	mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare
	their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted
	MRI brain image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report
	evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the
	affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate
	that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing brain extraction
	results (Jaccard=0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual
	information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic
	mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard=0.669±0.022).
	Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify
	the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our
	open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark
	parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study
	to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible
	evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal
	template construction and brain labeling.},

  abstract = {Publicly available scientific resources help establish evaluation
	standards, provide a platform for teaching and improve reproducibility.
	Version 4 of the Insight ToolKit (ITK(4)) seeks to establish new
	standards in publicly available image registration methodology. ITK(4)
	makes several advances in comparison to previous versions of ITK.
	ITK(4) supports both multivariate images and objective functions;
	it also unifies high-dimensional (deformation field) and low-dimensional
	(affine) transformations with metrics that are reusable across transform
	types and with composite transforms that allow arbitrary series of
	geometric mappings to be chained together seamlessly. Metrics and
	optimizers take advantage of multi-core resources, when available.
	Furthermore, ITK(4) reduces the parameter optimization burden via
	principled heuristics that automatically set scaling across disparate
	parameter types (rotations vs. translations). A related approach
	also constrains steps sizes for gradient-based optimizers. The result
	is that tuning for different metrics and/or image pairs is rarely
	necessary allowing the researcher to more easily focus on design/comparison
	of registration strategies. In total, the ITK(4) contribution is
	intended as a structure to support reproducible research practices,
	will provide a more extensive foundation against which to evaluate
	new work in image registration and also enable application level
	programmers a broad suite of tools on which to build. Finally, we
	contextualize this work with a reference registration evaluation
	study with application to pediatric brain labeling.},

	The Bayesian formulation of the segmentation problem is solved using

	the class intensities based on either parametric or non-parametric
	finite mixtures. Atropos is capable of incorporating spatial prior
	probability maps (sparse), prior label maps and/or Markov Random
	Field (MRF) modeling. Atropos has also been efficiently implemented
	to handle large quantities of possible labelings (in the experimental
	section, we use up to 69 classes) with a minimal memory footprint.
	This work describes the technical and implementation aspects of Atropos
	and evaluates its performance on two different ground-truth datasets.
	First, we use the BrainWeb dataset from Montreal Neurological Institute
	to evaluate three-tissue segmentation performance via (1) K-means
	segmentation without use of template data; (2) MRF segmentation with
	initialization by prior probability maps derived from a group template;
	(3) Prior-based segmentation with use of spatial prior probability
	maps derived from a group template. We also evaluate Atropos performance
	by using spatial priors to drive a 69-class EM segmentation problem
	derived from the Hammers atlas from University College London. These
	evaluation studies, combined with illustrative examples that exercise
	Atropos options, demonstrate both performance and wide applicability

  abstract = {Linking structural neuroimaging data from multiple modalities to cognitive
	performance is an important challenge for cognitive neuroscience.
	In this study we examined the relationship between verbal fluency
	performance and neuroanatomy in 54 patients with frontotemporal degeneration
	(FTD) and 15 age-matched controls, all of whom had T1- and diffusion-weighted
	imaging. Our goal was to incorporate measures of both gray matter
	(voxel-based cortical thickness) and white matter (fractional anisotropy)
	into a single statistical model that relates to behavioral performance.
	We first used eigenanatomy to define data-driven regions of interest
	(DD-ROIs) for both gray matter and white matter. Eigenanatomy is
	a multivariate dimensionality reduction approach that identifies
	spatially smooth, unsigned principal components that explain the
	maximal amount of variance across subjects. We then used a statistical
	model selection procedure to see which of these DD-ROIs best modeled
	performance on verbal fluency tasks hypothesized to rely on distinct
	components of a large-scale neural network that support language:
	category fluency requires a semantic-guided search and is hypothesized
	to rely primarily on temporal cortices that support lexical-semantic
	representations; letter-guided fluency requires a strategic mental
	search and is hypothesized to require executive resources to support
	a more demanding search process, which depends on prefrontal cortex
	in addition to temporal network components that support lexical representations.
	We observed that both types of verbal fluency performance are best
	described by a network that includes a combination of gray matter
	and white matter. For category fluency, the identified regions included
	bilateral temporal cortex and a white matter region including left
	inferior longitudinal fasciculus and frontal-occipital fasciculus.
	For letter fluency, a left temporal lobe region was also selected,
	and also regions of frontal cortex. These results are consistent
	with our hypothesized neuroanatomical models of language processing
	and its breakdown in FTD. We conclude that clustering the data with
	eigenanatomy before performing linear regression is a promising tool

	high heritability although most genes associated with these complex
	traits remain unidentified. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
	have relied on conventional 2D cardiovascular magnetic resonance
	(CMR) as the gold-standard for phenotyping. However this technique
	is insensitive to the regional variations in wall thickness which
	are often associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and require
	large cohorts to reach significance. Here we test whether automated
	cardiac phenotyping using high spatial resolution CMR atlases can
	achieve improved precision for mapping wall thickness in healthy
	populations and whether smaller sample sizes are required compared
	to conventional methods.LV short-axis cine images were acquired in
	138 healthy volunteers using standard 2D imaging and 3D high spatial
	resolution CMR. A multi-atlas technique was used to segment and co-register
	each image. The agreement between methods for end-diastolic volume
	and mass was made using Bland-Altman analysis in 20 subjects. The
	3D and 2D segmentations of the LV were compared to manual labeling
	by the proportion of concordant voxels (Dice coefficient) and the
	distances separating corresponding points. Parametric and nonparametric
	data were analysed with paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank test
	respectively. Voxelwise power calculations used the interstudy variances
	of wall thickness.The 3D volumetric measurements showed no bias compared
	to 2D imaging. The segmented 3D images were more accurate than 2D
	images for defining the epicardium (Dice: 0.95 vs 0.93, P<0.001;
	mean error 1.3 mm vs 2.2 mm, P<0.001) and endocardium (Dice 0.95
	vs 0.93, P<0.001; mean error 1.1 mm vs 2.0 mm, P<0.001). The 3D technique
	resulted in significant differences in wall thickness assessment
	at the base, septum and apex of the LV compared to 2D (P<0.001).
	Fewer subjects were required for 3D imaging to detect a 1 mm difference
	in wall thickness (72 vs 56, P<0.001).High spatial resolution CMR
	with automated phenotyping provides greater power for mapping wall
	thickness than conventional 2D imaging and enables a reduction in
	the sample size required for studies of environmental and genetic
	determinants of LV wall thickness.},

	analysis. p-Eigen starts with a common functional parcellation for
	all the subjects and refines it with subject-specific information.
	This enables modeling of the inter-subject variability in the functional
	parcel boundaries and allows us to construct subject-specific networks
	with reduced sensitivity to ROI placement. We show that while still
	maintaining correspondence across subjects, p-Eigen extracts biologically-relevant
	and patient-specific functional parcels that facilitate hypothesis-driven
	network analysis. We construct default mode network (DMN) connectivity
	graphs using p-Eigen refined ROIs and use them in a classification
	paradigm. Our results show that the functional connectivity graphs
	derived from p-Eigen significantly aid classification of mild cognitive
	impairment (MCI) as well as the prediction of scores in a Delayed
	Recall memory task when compared to graph metrics derived from 1)
	standard registration-based seed ROI definitions, 2) totally data-driven
	ROIs, 3) a model based on standard demographics plus hippocampal
	volume as covariates, and 4) Ward Clustering based data-driven ROIs.
	In summary, p-Eigen incarnates a new class of prior-constrained dimensionality
	reduction tools that may improve our understanding of the relationship
	between MCI and functional connectivity.},

	we learn a predictive relationship between local neuroanatomical

	us to produce an image of perfusion that would be predicted given
	only the underlying anatomy and a residual image that represents
	perfusion information that cannot be predicted by anatomical features.
	Our learned structural features are significantly better at predicting
	brain perfusion than tissue probability maps, which are the input
	to standard partial volume correction techniques. Studies in test-retest
	data show that both the anatomically predicted and residual perfusion
	signals are highly replicable for a given subject. In a pediatric
	population, both the raw perfusion and structurally predicted images
	are tightly linked to age throughout adolescence throughout the brain.
	Interestingly, the residual perfusion also shows a strong correlation

	Mass-univariate methods for extracting correlations between image
	voxels and outcome measurements are not ideal for multimodal datasets,

	The extremely high dimensionality of medical images necessitates
	dimensionality reduction, such as principal component analysis (PCA)

	sparse eigenvectors and selecting a subset of the eigenvectors to
	make interpretable predictions from a multi-modal dataset. Evaluation

	that make signal estimation difficult. These include variation in
	the hemodynamic response across voxels and low signal-to-noise ratio

	problems for event-related fMRI. (1) Many fMRI analyses assume a
	canonical hemodynamic response function, but this assumption may
	lead to inaccurate data models. By adopting the finite impulse response
	model, we show that voxel-specific hemodynamic response functions
	can be estimated directly from the data. (2) There is a large amount

	dependent (BOLD) time-series data. To compensate for this problem,

	substantially improves SNR and is more accurate than high-pass filtering
	of the data. (3) Model overfitting is a problem for the finite impulse
	response model because of the low SNR of the BOLD response. To reduce
	overfitting, we estimate a hemodynamic response timecourse for each
	voxel and incorporate the constraint of time-event separability,
	the constraint that hemodynamic responses across event types are
	identical up to a scale factor. We show that this technique substantially
	improves the accuracy of hemodynamic response estimates and can be
	computed efficiently. For the analysis techniques we present, we

  abstract = {In task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), researchers

	In many circumstances, measuring this signal of interest is limited

	improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by entering noise regressors
	into a general linear model (GLM) analysis of fMRI data. The noise
	regressors are derived by conducting an initial model fit to determine
	voxels unrelated to the experimental paradigm, performing principal
	components analysis (PCA) on the time-series of these voxels, and
	using cross-validation to select the optimal number of principal
	components to use as noise regressors. Due to the use of data resampling,
	GLMdenoise requires and is best suited for datasets involving multiple
	runs (where conditions repeat across runs). We show that GLMdenoise
	consistently improves cross-validation accuracy of GLM estimates
	on a variety of event-related experimental datasets and is accompanied
	by substantial gains in SNR. To promote practical application of
	methods, we provide MATLAB code implementing GLMdenoise. Furthermore,
	to help compare GLMdenoise to other denoising methods, we present
	the Denoise Benchmark (DNB), a public database and architecture for

  abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most common causes of long-term
	disability. Despite the importance of identifying neuropathology
	in individuals with chronic TBI, methodological challenges posed
	at the stage of inter-subject image registration have hampered previous
	voxel-based MRI studies from providing a clear pattern of structural
	atrophy after TBI. We used a novel symmetric diffeomorphic image
	normalization method to conduct a tensor-based morphometry (TBM)
	study of TBI. The key advantage of this method is that it simultaneously
	estimates an optimal template brain and topology preserving deformations
	between this template and individual subject brains. Detailed patterns
	of atrophies are then revealed by statistically contrasting control
	and subject deformations to the template space. Participants were
	29 survivors of TBI and 20 control subjects who were matched in terms
	of age, gender, education, and ethnicity. Localized volume losses
	were found most prominently in white matter regions and the subcortical
	nuclei including the thalamus, the midbrain, the corpus callosum,
	the mid- and posterior cingulate cortices, and the caudate. Significant
	voxel-wise volume loss clusters were also detected in the cerebellum
	and the frontal/temporal neocortices. Volume enlargements were identified
	largely in ventricular regions. A similar pattern of results was
	observed in a subgroup analysis where we restricted our analysis
	to the 17 TBI participants who had no macroscopic focal lesions (total
	lesion volume >1.5 cm(3)). The current study confirms, extends, and
	partly challenges previous structural MRI studies in chronic TBI.
	By demonstrating that a large deformation image registration technique
	can be successfully combined with TBM to identify TBI-induced diffuse
	structural changes with greater precision, our approach is expected
	to increase the sensitivity of future studies examining brain-behavior
	relationships in the TBI population.},

	lobar degeneration (FTLD) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology.
	It is critical to establish statistically powerful biomarkers that
	can achieve substantial cost-savings and increase the feasibility
	of clinical trials. We assessed three broad categories of neuroimaging
	methods to screen underlying FTLD and AD pathology in a clinical
	FTD series: global measures (e.g., ventricular volume), anatomical
	volumes of interest (VOIs) (e.g., hippocampus) using a standard atlas,
	and data-driven VOIs using Eigenanatomy. We evaluated clinical FTD
	patients (N = 93) with cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter (GM) magnetic
	resonance imaging (MRI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess
	whether they had underlying FTLD or AD pathology. Linear regression
	was performed to identify the optimal VOIs for each method in a training
	dataset and then we evaluated classification sensitivity and specificity
	in an independent test cohort. Power was evaluated by calculating
	minimum sample sizes required in the test classification analyses

  abstract = {Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is most commonly associated
	with TAR-DNA binding protein (TDP-43) or tau pathology at autopsy,
	but there are no in vivo biomarkers reliably discriminating between
	sporadic cases. As disease-modifying treatments emerge, it is critical
	to accurately identify underlying pathology in living patients so
	that they can be entered into appropriate etiology-directed clinical
	trials. Patients with tau inclusions (FTLD-TAU) appear to have relatively
	greater white matter (WM) disease at autopsy than those patients
	with TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP). In this paper, we investigate the ability
	of white matter (WM) imaging to help discriminate between FTLD-TAU
	and FTLD-TDP during life using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).Patients
	with autopsy-confirmed disease or a genetic mutation consistent with
	FTLD-TDP or FTLD-TAU underwent multimodal T1 volumetric MRI and diffusion
	weighted imaging scans. We quantified cortical thickness in GM and
	fractional anisotropy (FA) in WM. We performed Eigenanatomy, a statistically
	robust dimensionality reduction algorithm, and used leave-one-out
	cross-validation to predict underlying pathology. Neuropathological
	assessment of GM and WM disease burden was performed in the autopsy-cases
	to confirm our findings of an ante-mortem GM and WM dissociation
	in the neuroimaging cohort.ROC curve analyses evaluated classification
	accuracy in individual patients and revealed 96\% sensitivity and
	100\% specificity for WM analyses. FTLD-TAU had significantly more
	WM degeneration and inclusion severity at autopsy relative to FTLD-TDP.These
	neuroimaging and neuropathological investigations provide converging
	evidence for greater WM burden associated with FTLD-TAU, and emphasise
	the role of WM neuroimaging for in vivo discrimination between FTLD-TAU
	and FTLD-TDP.},

  abstract = {Diffeomorphic mappings are central to image registration due largely
	to their topological properties and success in providing biologically
	plausible solutions to deformation and morphological estimation problems.
	Popular diffeomorphic image registration algorithms include those
	characterized by time-varying and constant velocity fields, and symmetrical
	considerations. Prior information in the form of regularization is
	used to enforce transform plausibility taking the form of physics-based
	constraints or through some approximation thereof, e.g., Gaussian
	smoothing of the vector fields [a la Thirion's Demons (Thirion, 1998)].
	In the context of the original Demons' framework, the so-called directly
	manipulated free-form deformation (DMFFD) (Tustison et al., 2009)
	can be viewed as a smoothing alternative in which explicit regularization
	is achieved through fast B-spline approximation. This characterization
	can be used to provide B-spline "flavored" diffeomorphic image registration
	solutions with several advantages. Implementation is open source

	Tools (ANTs) repository. A thorough comparative evaluation with the

  abstract = {Many studies of the human brain have explored the relationship between
	cortical thickness and cognition, phenotype, or disease. Due to the
	subjectivity and time requirements in manual measurement of cortical
	thickness, scientists have relied on robust software tools for automation
	which facilitate the testing and refinement of neuroscientific hypotheses.
	The most widely used tool for cortical thickness studies is the publicly
	available, surface-based FreeSurfer package. Critical to the adoption
	of such tools is a demonstration of their reproducibility, validity,
	and the documentation of specific implementations that are robust
	across large, diverse imaging datasets. To this end, we have developed
	the automated, volume-based Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) cortical
	thickness pipeline comprising well-vetted components such as SyGN
	(multivariate template construction), SyN (image registration), N4
	(bias correction), Atropos (n-tissue segmentation), and DiReCT (cortical
	thickness estimation). In this work, we have conducted the largest
	evaluation of automated cortical thickness measures in publicly available
	data, comparing FreeSurfer and ANTs measures computed on 1205 images
	from four open data sets (IXI, MMRR, NKI, and OASIS), with parcellation
	based on the recently proposed Desikan-Killiany-Tourville (DKT) cortical
	labeling protocol. We found good scan-rescan repeatability with both
	FreeSurfer and ANTs measures. Given that such assessments of precision
	do not necessarily reflect accuracy or an ability to make statistical
	inferences, we further tested the neurobiological validity of these
	approaches by evaluating thickness-based prediction of age and gender.
	ANTs is shown to have a higher predictive performance than FreeSurfer
	for both of these measures. In promotion of open science, we make
	all of our scripts, data, and results publicly available which complements
	the use of open image data sets and the open source availability
	of the proposed ANTs cortical thickness pipeline.},

	such complications, we introduce a framework for supervised segmentation
	based on multiple modality intensity, geometry, and asymmetry feature
	sets. These features drive a supervised whole-brain and tumor segmentation
	approach based on random forest-derived probabilities. The asymmetry-related
	features (based on optimal symmetric multimodal templates) demonstrate
	excellent discriminative properties within this framework. We also
	gain performance by generating probability maps from random forest
	models and using these maps for a refining Markov random field regularized
	probabilistic segmentation. This strategy allows us to interface
	the supervised learning capabilities of the random forest model with
	regularized probabilistic segmentation using the recently developed
	ANTsR package-a comprehensive statistical and visualization interface
	between the popular Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) and the R
	statistical project. The reported algorithmic framework was the top-performing

	of the AVOI intersected by a sphere centered by a set of coordinates,
	and (3) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected
	by an activated cluster. An interface with the Statistical Parametric
	Mapping package (SPM, J. Ashburner and K. J. Friston, 1999, Hum.
	Brain Mapp. 7, 254-266) is provided as a freeware to researchers
	of the neuroimaging community. We believe that this tool is an improvement
	for the macroscopical labeling of activated area compared to labeling
	assessed using the Talairach atlas brain in which deformations are
	well known. However, this tool does not alleviate the need for more
	sophisticated labeling strategies based on anatomical or cytoarchitectonic
	probabilistic maps.},

  abstract = {We propose a simple but generally applicable approach to improving
	the accuracy of automatic image segmentation algorithms relative
	to manual segmentations. The approach is based on the hypothesis
	that a large fraction of the errors produced by automatic segmentation
	are systematic, i.e., occur consistently from subject to subject,
	and serves as a wrapper method around a given host segmentation method.
	The wrapper method attempts to learn the intensity, spatial and contextual
	patterns associated with systematic segmentation errors produced
	by the host method on training data for which manual segmentations
	are available. The method then attempts to correct such errors in
	segmentations produced by the host method on new images. One practical
	use of the proposed wrapper method is to adapt existing segmentation
	tools, without explicit modification, to imaging data and segmentation
	protocols that are different from those on which the tools were trained
	and tuned. An open-source implementation of the proposed wrapper
	method is provided, and can be applied to a wide range of image segmentation
	problems. The wrapper method is evaluated with four host brain MRI
	segmentation methods: hippocampus segmentation using FreeSurfer (Fischl
	et al., 2002); hippocampus segmentation using multi-atlas label fusion
	(Artaechevarria et al., 2009); brain extraction using BET (Smith,
	2002); and brain tissue segmentation using FAST (Zhang et al., 2001).
	The wrapper method generates 72\%, 14\%, 29\% and 21\% fewer erroneously
	segmented voxels than the respective host segmentation methods. In
	the hippocampus segmentation experiment with multi-atlas label fusion
	as the host method, the average Dice overlap between reference segmentations
	and segmentations produced by the wrapper method is 0.908 for normal
	controls and 0.893 for patients with mild cognitive impairment. Average
	Dice overlaps of 0.964, 0.905 and 0.951 are obtained for brain extraction,
	white matter segmentation and gray matter segmentation, respectively.},

  title = {Multi-atlas segmentation with joint label fusion and corrective learning-an
	open source implementation.},
  journal = {Front Neuroinform},
  year = {2013},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {27},
  abstract = {Label fusion based multi-atlas segmentation has proven to be one of
	the most competitive techniques for medical image segmentation. This
	technique transfers segmentations from expert-labeled images, called
	atlases, to a novel image using deformable image registration. Errors
	produced by label transfer are further reduced by label fusion that
	combines the results produced by all atlases into a consensus solution.
	Among the proposed label fusion strategies, weighted voting with
	spatially varying weight distributions derived from atlas-target
	intensity similarity is a simple and highly effective label fusion
	technique. However, one limitation of most weighted voting methods
	is that the weights are computed independently for each atlas, without
	taking into account the fact that different atlases may produce similar
	label errors. To address this problem, we recently developed the
	joint label fusion technique and the corrective learning technique,
	which won the first place of the 2012 MICCAI Multi-Atlas Labeling
	Challenge and was one of the top performers in 2013 MICCAI Segmentation:
	Algorithms, Theory and Applications (SATA) challenge. To make our
	techniques more accessible to the scientific research community,
	we describe an Insight-Toolkit based open source implementation of
	our label fusion methods. Our implementation extends our methods
	to work with multi-modality imaging data and is more suitable for
	segmentation problems with multiple labels. We demonstrate the usage
	of our tools through applying them to the 2012 MICCAI Multi-Atlas
	Labeling Challenge brain image dataset and the 2013 SATA challenge
	canine leg image dataset. We report the best results on these two
	datasets so far.},
